# GENBYTES-Playground

Welcome to my hands-on exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs)! This repository showcases a series of practical projects that demonstrate the power and versatility of modern AI technologies. 

*This work is part of my journey through the comprehensive course [Mastering Generative AI and LLMs: An 8-Week Hands-On Journey](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models) led by Ed Donner.*


## Project Files Description

- **advanced_level_math_tutor.py**: math tutor using GPT and Llama models with a detective-style teaching approach.
- **marketing_insights_webscraper.py**: Web scraping tool for marketing insights using Selenium and OpenAI's GPT for analysis.
- **meeting_transcriber.py**: Meeting transcription tool using OpenAI's Whisper and Llama models for generating meeting minutes.
- **python_to_multilang_code_converter.py**: Code conversion tool that translates Python code to C++, C, and Rust using AI models.
- **test_data_generator.py**: Synthetic test data generator using HuggingFace's LLaMA model.

<br>

- **flight_assistant.py**: flight booking assistant with image generation, speech synthesis, and chat capabilities using OpenAI's GPT and DALL-E models.
- **website_chatbot.py**: chatbot for an EdTech platform with audio transcription and feedback collection features.

### HuggingFace
- **huggingface_models_text_generation_playground.py**: Text generation playground using various HuggingFace models like Llama, Phi-3, Gemma, Qwen2, and Mixtral.
- **huggingface_pipelines_playground.py**: Demonstration of HuggingFace pipelines for tasks like sentiment analysis, NER, QA, and text generation.
- **huggingface_tokenizer_playground.py**: Exploration of different tokenization approaches using HuggingFace tokenizers.


## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (Python 3.13 not yet supported)
- Git
- macOS (for these specific instructions)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenBytes-Playground.git
cd GenBytes-Playground
```

2. **Environment Setup (Option 1: Using Anaconda)**
```bash
# Install Anaconda from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate genbytes
```

3. **Environment Setup (Option 2: Using venv)**
```bash
python -m venv genbytes
source genbytes/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Requirements
- OpenAI API key (for GPT and DALL-E models)
- Anthropic API key (for Claude models)
- HuggingFace API token (for accessing HuggingFace models)
- Selenium WebDriver (for web scraping features)

### Configuration
1. Copy the `.env` file to `.env`
2. Add your API keys and configurations to the `.env` file


## Output Variability Notice
- Please note that the outputs generated by our code conversion tool are powered by AI technology, which incorporates elements of randomness in its operation. <br>

- This means you might see different results if you submit the same request multiple times. 

- The 'temperature' and 'top_p' settings of the models influence the degree of randomness, with lower values leading to more consistent outputs. 

- We recommend using these settings judiciously to balance creativity and determinism based on your specific needs.
